Our stay was short (3 days, 2 nights) but the experience is still very memorable. We visited the park in May 2023, a lovely season after the rains and the park was green and lush. We plan to go back in another season and see what changes.</p><p>Meru NP is home to among others, the big 5 (<strong>lion, leopard, rhino, elephant, buffalo)</strong>, some of <a href="https://samburunationalreservekenya.com/information/samburu-special-five/?ref=localhost">the Samburu special</a> five (b<strong>eisa oryx, reticulated giraffe, somali ostrich, grevy&apos;s zebra, rerenuk</strong>), *not sure if all 5 are available), many bird species, etc. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://stuckinlowrange.com/content/images/2024/02/PXL_20230507_044506938_Original.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Meru National Park - Our best park visit so far" loading="lazy"></figure><p>It is nestled amidst lush green vegetation, red volcanic soil, and expansive open plains which regrettably, we couldn&apos;t fully explore (the park is huge, covering around 870 square km). Nourished by 13 rivers and numerous streams. Found on the slopes of Nyambene ranges and sits to the northeast of Mount Kenya, past Meru and Maua town.</p><p><strong>There are two routes to get here:</strong><br>1) Nairobi - Embu - Meru<br>2) Nairobi - Nanyuki - Meru - Opting for the Nanyuki route led us to the Murera gate, one of the park&apos;s two entrances, the other being the Ura gate.</p><p>Meru NP is a part of the <a href="https://www.kws.go.ke/file/1469/download?token=b0vMzj3A&amp;ref=localhost">Meru Conservation Area</a> that collectively spans 4,000 square km, and includes two reserves and two national parks - &#xA0;Bisanadi NR, Mwingi NR, Kora NP, and Meru NP. An area around the Tana River system, Kenya&apos;s longest river.</p><p>We stayed at <a href="https://www.rhinorivercamp.com/?ref=localhost">Rhino River Camp</a>, opposite the Rhino Sanctuary gate to the park. The tented camp is set along a riverline, the Kindani River. Offering an authentic nature immersion with a blend of luxury and exploration. With a restaurant, bar, pool, play area with board games, daily game drives, and impeccable service, it&apos;s a perfect space for glamping and enjoying the luxury of being in nature.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://stuckinlowrange.com/content/images/2024/02/PXL_20230508_045353237_Original.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="Meru National Park - Our best park visit so far" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Though we enjoy camping, this was a different experience and a welcome change once in a while when the budget allows. The cost is high if you are used to camping in the wild, but their service and experience are well worth your money. There is a public camping site in the park that we plan to stay at the next time we visit.</p><p><strong>Some highlights of our visit include:</strong><br>1) <strong>Abundant wildlife</strong> &#xA0;- We were treated to several herds of buffaloes, many hippos (make sure to have breakfast by the hippos), elephants, giraffes, rhinos (they have a rhino sanctuary), many bird species, and lovely vegetation among others.<br>2) <strong>Best guided service we&apos;ve had so far</strong> - The guide from the Rhino River camp and organized by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/porinicamps/?ref=localhost">Porini camps</a> was knowledgeable, shared a lot of insights on nature, culture, the national park business, and reflected on his career as a guide. We&apos;re deeply grateful for his expertise and how he is passionately dedicated to the job and the need to protect nature and wildlife, he also shared sustainable travel tips especially in parks. Bless his heart.<br>3) <strong>The road trip - </strong>Through a lovely landscape. From Timau to Meru, the expansive landscape leading to Meru screams fertile and productive grounds where nature thrives and people are hard at work. We even got a chance to observe the renowned khat (miraa) business. Those cars move fast! It&apos;s always great interacting with the people and observing the economic activities of a place.</p><p><strong>Some other things about Meru np:</strong><br>Featured in the film &quot;<a href="https://www.bornfree.org.uk/news/born-free-meru/?ref=localhost">Born Free</a>,&quot; Meru boasts the burial site of Elsa, immortalized by George and Joy Adamson&apos;s work.<br>Despite past challenges with poaching, the park has made remarkable strides in conservation efforts. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hot springs, geysers, and natural pools in Kenya]]></title><description><![CDATA[Natural pools and hot springs hold ecological memories of a place. ]]></description><link>https://stuckinlowrange.com/hot-springs-geysers-and-natural-pools-in-kenya/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">66d4306208e16f47a0f65674</guid><category><![CDATA[hot springs]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stuck in Low Range]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 10:25:21 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://stuckinlowrange.com/content/images/2024/02/26FCD47D-ED53-4CA4-A078-53B13D07A642.JPG" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="one-unspoken-rule-of-adventure-is-if-there-is-a-water-body-you-have-to-take-a-dip-whether-warm-or-cold-and-if-its-safe-to-do-so">One unspoken rule of adventure is, if there is a water body, you have to take a dip.

What is a bad pace? Who gets to determine the pace? Are we in control?</p><p>After the chaos of COVID-19 and the endless days spent indoors, we have all been craving a break from Zoom meetings, excessive screen time, and mundane routines confined within four walls of our apartments. We all want to be outside. And it sure is a treat to be immersed in nature. Time passes differently while sleeping on open grounds in <a href="https://g.co/kgs/GrpT7sg?ref=localhost"><strong>Koobi Fora </strong></a>under a clear night full of stars.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://stuckinlowrange.com/content/images/2024/02/DSC04481-2.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="How do you pace your adventures?" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Koobi Fora</figcaption></figure><p>We like the pace of the outdoors. It&#x2019;s hard to put this in perspective, but we can try.</p><p>From rushing to not miss a sunset to slowing down to take a view in, the pace is sometimes slow, other times fast depending on what one seeks. </p><p>A most memorable moment for us was the pressure to get through the gate of a national park as we had underestimated the time and the gates close at 6 pm. While we needed to speed up and get there in time, you could feel the pressure, and enthusiasm for camping turned into anxiety about getting locked out. Pace goes beyond the literal speed, to a feeling, in a given time and place. </p><p>In outdoorsy adventures, &apos;pace&apos; is omnipresent.</p><p>It&apos;s about the speed, rhythm, flow, and how we want to experience any activity. It&apos;s an energy that surrounds the adventure. The tempo we adopt, whether individually or as a group. Sometimes it&#x2019;s about going with the flow either imposed by nature or self-imposed. Lazy evenings with play and conversations, slow mornings, or collaborative packing when it&apos;s time to leave.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://stuckinlowrange.com/content/images/2024/02/PXL_20230816_131614014_Original-1.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="How do you pace your adventures?" loading="lazy"><figcaption><a href="https://g.co/kgs/T26naDC?ref=localhost">Petrified forest in Sibiloi National Park</a></figcaption></figure><p>Phrases like &apos;at your own pace,&apos; &apos;watch your pace,&apos; &apos;pace yourself,&apos; and &apos;pick your pace&apos; come to mind. The reaction to such depends on the mood and state of mind one is in. For instance, &apos;at your own pace&apos; lands well when one is trying to navigate the last stretch of a hike at the humbling <a href="https://g.co/kgs/pZbXstk?ref=localhost"><strong>Elephant Hill</strong></a><strong> (</strong>a story for another day), while &quot;pick up the pace&quot; might not be the best thing one wants to hear on the last km of a <a href="https://www.lewasafarimarathon.com/?ref=localhost"><strong>Lewa marathon</strong></a><strong> (</strong>one of the best weekend experience we have had). </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://stuckinlowrange.com/content/images/2024/02/D729E47D-DD47-4F5A-AC43-F6755F08501A-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How do you pace your adventures?" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Elephant Hill, mid-point</figcaption></figure><p>Pace is crucial in various settings, be it hiking, walking, running, cooking at camp, or off-roading. It&#x2019;s about being mindful, knowing your limits, pushing boundaries, enhancing endurance, or simply slowing down to appreciate the moment. Sometimes a call to observe, be open-minded, listen, push more, let your senses wander, or speed up to not miss out on the last moments of a sunset that wait for no one.</p><p>In groups, pace could be about sticking together, moving in a convoy, communicating over walkie-talkies, and ensuring no one is left behind. A form of camaraderie. </p><p>Individually, pacing is more personal. Finding comfort in your rhythm. Solo, it can be easy to determine your own pace, but within a large group, it can be a struggle to keep up. For instance, in large group adventures, we&#x2019;ve found keeping up with speed on the road a bit challenging. Cars have differing capabilities off-road, driving styles vary, and sometimes, a need to keep distance to avoid being covered in clouds of dust, as was the case in a group trip to the Chalbi Dessert. While traveling in groups is great as it builds community, and is safer for certain environments, it can be a challenge to keep up. For instance, you might want to take a break to take in a view on the road while others might not find it appealing. Balancing and a bit of compromise come in handy in such a setup.<br></p><p>There are instances where pace becomes exhilarating. For instance, a rush of adrenaline on open roads with windows down or when you see the peak after hours of hiking. Other times, slowing down and taking it all in is the reason we go outdoorsy.<br></p><hr><p>One key lesson we&#x2019;ve learned in adventure is the art of pacing. </p><p>Building your own pace. This can be achieved through taking breaks, having an early start, structuring plans to allow for leisurely days, or going all out when wanting to meet some goals. </p><p>Some of this pacing is self-imposed, while others are dictated by nature. Like slowing down on rocky terrain, speeding up on loose sandy trails, pushing oneself to make it in time to catch a sunset atop Mt. Ololokwe, increasing pace to meet a marathon goal, or surrendering to slow cooking when the winds up north get intense. On our trip to Lake Turkana and Koobi Fora, we had really underestimated cooking in a windy camp. </p><p>Reflecting on pace, we realize that motivations for adventure vary. In our case, it&#x2019;s mostly been about slowing down, seeking solace from the chaos of the everyday hustle, and immersing ourselves in the serenity of slow adventures. To take in landscapes, and culture, talk to people, and observe the infrastructure and economic activities. Whether it&#x2019;s absorbing a breathtaking view or marveling at how the sunrise hits the water while camping at Malindi National Reserve. Pacing becomes both a practice and a necessity.<br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://stuckinlowrange.com/content/images/2024/02/PXL_20230828_032926854-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How do you pace your adventures?" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Sunrise at Malindi Marine Park &amp; Reserve</figcaption></figure><p>What is gained transfers to everyday life. We&apos;ve learned to pace ourselves, remain adaptable, and align our pace with our goals, both on and off the road. </p><p>Some things require energetic vibes, while others demand a slow tempo. Beyond speed, slow or hasty, and how things move, we think pace is a mood, an adventure energy, an approach to life. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://stuckinlowrange.com/content/images/2024/02/PXL_20230816_035124573-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How do you pace your adventures?" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Snack break on the road</figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[60 Things on Camping]]></title><description><![CDATA[Some tips, thoughts, and observations on camping.]]></description><link>https://stuckinlowrange.com/60-things-on-camping-2/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">66d4306208e16f47a0f65670</guid><category><![CDATA[camping]]></category><category><![CDATA[camping in kenya]]></category><category><![CDATA[national parks in kenya]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stuck in Low Range]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 13:28:05 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://stuckinlowrange.com/content/images/2024/02/PXL_20230826_041515556.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://stuckinlowrange.com/content/images/2024/02/PXL_20230826_041515556.jpg" alt="60 Things on Camping"><p>Some tips, thoughts, and observations on camping.</p><ol><li>Packing is a skill, pack light.</li><li>Prioritize the essentials.</li><li>Have collaborative planning lists or docs.</li><li>Divide and concur the prep and research work.</li><li>If going with kids, involve them in packing too, it gets them excited about the trip.</li><li>The weather app is a handy guide.</li><li>Plan your route on maps.</li><li>Camping can be costly, start small, and build gear over time.
